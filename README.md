# sim-seaports

The simulation aims to show the advantage of using Hyperloop in seaports.

Basic assumptions include:
1. Cargo container is loaded onto a conveyer belt as soon as it leaves the ship.
2. Conveyor belt takes the container directly into the airlock.
3. The system operates fast enough, so that no bottleneck is created on the terminal side. 

Data about the seaport cargo handling, standard definitions come from this paper: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1OGfJ-ZYtvobFNPWHNuamctQ3M
